# Countdown Timer GUI

This is my first time using [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter), which is the standard Python GUI.

This took around 3.5 hours to get the minimum functionality up and running. I spent a bit of time messing around with the widget padding/placement so realistically could have done it a bit quicker.

TODOs:
1. Fix layout of buttons, they're not quite centered.
2. Alternatively, consider placing them relative to the window size, rather than hard-coding the placement.
3. Add stop/pause functionality.
4. Testing.
5. Refactor to make code more modular and not just one big file.
