# Python Projects

This is a repo of Python projects that I found interesting. Most of these will be small, one-day projects. Some will end up becoming larger projects.

1. **Countdown Timer GUI**
* This is a basic countdown timer ```HH:MM:SS``` and was made with the Tkinter library.
2. **SMS Reminder Service**
* You can text this service to remind you about something and it will text you a reminder at a given time.
