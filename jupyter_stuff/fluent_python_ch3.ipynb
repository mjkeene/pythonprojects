    "\n",
    "All mapping types in the standard library use the basic `dict` in their implementation, so they share the limitation that the keys must be <i>hashable</i> (the values don't need to be hashable, only the keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "From the [Python Glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-hashable):\n",
    "\n",
    "\"An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a __hash__() method), and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() method). Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member, because these data structures use the hash value internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of Pythonâ€™s immutable built-in objects are hashable; mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are not; immutable containers (such as tuples and frozensets) are only hashable if their elements are hashable. Objects which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default. They all compare unequal (except with themselves), and their hash value is derived from their id().\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The atomic immutable types (`str, bytes,` numeric types) are all hashable. A `frozenset` is always hashable, because its elements must be hashable by definition. A tuple is only hashable if all items are hashable. See examples below."

    "<h3>Hash Tables in Dictionaries</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level overview of how Python uses a hash table to implement a `dict`. \n",
    "\n",
    "A hash table is a sparse array (i.e., an array that always has empty cells). The cells in a hash table are typically called \"buckets.\" In a `dict` hash table, there is a bucket for each item, and it contains two fields: a reference to the key, an da reference to the value of the item. Because all of the buckets have the same size, access to an individual bucket is done by offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python tries to keep at least 1/3 of the buckets empty; if the hash table becomes too crowded, it is copied to a new location with room for more buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put an item in a hash table, the first step is to calculate the <i>hash value</i> of the item key, which is done with the `hash()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**hash() function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hash()` built-in function works directly with built-in types and falls back to calling `__hash__` for user-defined types. If two obejcts compare equal, their hash values must also be equal, otherwise the hash table algorithm does not work. For example, because `1 == 1.0` is True, `hash(1) == hash(1.0)` must also be True, even though the internal representation of an int and float are very different.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be effective as hash table indexes, hash values should scatter around the index space as much as possible. This means that, ideally, objects that are similar but not equal should have hash values that differ widely."

    "<h3>Hash table algorithm</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "To fetch a value at `my_dict[search_key]`, Python calls `hash(search_key)` to obtain the <i>hash value</i> of `search_key` and uses the least significant bits of that number as an offset to look up a bucket in the hash table (number of bits depends on the current size of the table). If the found bucket is empty, `KeyError` is raised. Otherwise, the found bucket has an item -- a found_key:found_value pair -- and then Python checks whether `search_key == found_key`. If they match, that was the item sought, and found_value is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if `search_key` and `found_key` do not match, this is a <i>hash collision</i>. This happens because a hash function maps arbitrary objects to a small number of bits, and the has table is also indexed with a subset of those bits. In order to resolve the collision, the algorithm then takes different bits in the hash, massages them in a particular way, and uses the result as an offset to look up a different bucket. If that is empty, `KeyError` is raised; if not, either the keys match and the item value is returned, or the collision resolution process is repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a hash table grows, so does the number of hash bits used as bucket offsets, and this keeps the rate of collisions low.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keys must be hashable objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is hashable if all of these requirements are met:\n",
    "1. It supports the `hash()` function via a `hash()` method that always returns the same value over the lifetime of the object.\n",
    "2. It supports equality via an `eq()` method.\n",
    "3. If `a == b` is True, then `hash(a) == hash(b)` must also be True\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined types are hashable by default because their hash value is their `id()` and they all compare not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you implement a class with a custom `__eq__` method, you must also implement a suitable `__hash__`, because you must always make sure that if `a == b` is True, then `hash(a) == hash(b)` is also True. Otherwis you are breaking an invariant of the hash table algorithm, and dicts and sets will not deal reliably with your objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**memory overhead**\n",
    "Because a `dict` uses a hash table internally, which must be sparse to work, they are not space efficient. With a large quantity of records, it makes sense to store them in a list of tuples or named tuples instead of using a list of dictionaries in JSON style, with one dict per record. Replacing dicts with tuples reduces the memory usage in two ways: removing the overhead of one hash table per record, and by not storing the field names again with each record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind we are talking about space optimizations. If you are dealing with a few million objects and your machine has gigabytes of RAM, you should postpone such optimizations until they are actually warranted. Optimization is the altar where maintainability is sacrificed.\n"
